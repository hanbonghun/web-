<h2>AJAX</h2>
<p>AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.</p>

<p>AJAX is not a programming language.</p>

<p>AJAX just uses a combination of:</p>

<p>A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)
AJAX is a misleading name. AJAX applications might use XML to transport data, but it is equally common to transport data as plain text or JSON text.</p>

AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.
